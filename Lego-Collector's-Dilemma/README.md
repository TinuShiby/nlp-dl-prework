### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Initially the given data set is splitted into X_train, y_train, X_test and y_test. Latter a scatter plot is plotted and then eliminate the columns with redundancy. Later from scikit -learn imported LinearRegression and instantiate it ad make it fit to the training data set and y is predicted and calculated the mean square error and R square error. In the final step residual is calculated and a histogram for residual is plotted.
